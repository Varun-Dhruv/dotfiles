# Dotfiles
## What is the repository about?
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.
I was a little tired of having multiple configurations split across the system for various tools like zsh ,neovim etc. That led to this project, I 
realized I can split a lot of things up into main areas I used(Neovim,git,zsh, and so on) and so I structured the project accordingly
## Installation
 *warning* : If you want to give these dotfiles a try,you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or 
 need. Dont blindly use my settings unless you know what entails. Use at your own risk
